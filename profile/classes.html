    Here's a place holder for a zip of the project <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="../classes.zip">classes link</a>
    <p>Note:<br>
    If you implement the project the project still has security issues some obvious some not so much<br>
    For instance the current way that it is implemented yo can see the database information from the browser<br>
    The page is also vulnarble to sql injections, although injecrtions are accounted for not all of them<br>
    There's even an intersting one where you can implement php commands by entering in hyperlinks and bypass the forms which if done correctly can lead to some errors in the database<br>
    There's also the issue of using Java to run in the background which would need to change<br>
    Implementation Coming Soon...</p>

    <p>Database Management Systems<br><br>
        This course built upon the concepts presented in CSI 215 about database schemeas. Topics covered will included SQL tuning, and the implementation, support, and maintenance of relational databases. In addition, techniques for architecting, building, and scaling databases for future growth were presented. Special emphasis were given to database security, performance, and availability.<br>
        Throughout the course of the class we built a website using a traditional liniux machine. On the webserver that we hosted we demostrated utilizing php, html, and css and even some Java. The orginal project is no longer being hosted, but using this space I will try to host the orginal project.</p> -->


    <h3 class="class-title">CSI 300 Computer Organiz/Architecture</h3>
      <li>
        This course concentrated on the relationship between computing hardware and machine language instruction sets as well as introductory digital electronics. The course examines logic gates, machine language and assembly language. We also studied digital electronics, computer circuit design with small and medium scale integrated circuits. Several computer systems and microprocessors were used as examples.
      </li>
    <h3 class="class-title">CSI 330 Data Structures and Algorithms</h3>
      <li>
        A study of common and useful data structures such as lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs and variations of these structures along with the essential and necessary algorithms to manipulate these structures. Algorithms that were covered included searching, and sorting techniques, data traversals, graph algorithms, numerical algorithms, string algorithms and hashing.
      </li>
    <h3 class="class-title">CSI 410 Software Engineering</h3>
      <li>
        This course provided us with an opportunity to work on large-scale, group programming projects. Topics included tools for large-scale design, documentation techniques, programming paradigms (e.g. Object Oriented Programming) and portability issues.
      </li>
    <h3 class="class-title">CSI 415 Advanced Database Concepts</h3>
      <li>
        This course built upon the concepts presented in CSI 215 about database schemeas. Topics covered included SQL tuning, and the implementation, support, and maintenance of relational databases. In addition, techniques for architecting, building, and scaling databases for future growth were presented. Special emphasis were given to database security, performance, and availability.
      </li>
    <h3 class="class-title">CSI 425 Web Programming</h3>
      <li>
        This course investigated the use of programming tools that are useful in developing web-based applications. A portion of the course examined client side scripting using tools such as JavaScript or Java applets. However, the focus was on server side tools such as Java servlets and php scripts. We studied how to use these programs to interact with a database system. Standard encryption methods for web-based applications such as the use of SSL, the secure socket layer, were also be presented.
      </li>
    <h3 class="class-title">CSI 430 Comp Graph/User Intrfc Design</h3>
      <li>
        This course introduced us to programming techniques necessary for the production of programs which produce graphical images and/or use a graphical interface. We produced programs which use interactive graphics and  studied the necessary theories which underlies modern graphical programming. Topics included drawing algorithms, matrix manipulations, 2D and 3D rendering techniques, color models, user interface concepts, interactive graphics and animation techniques.
      </li>
    <h3 class="class-title">CSI 440 Artificial Intelligence</h3>
      <li>
        This course was a study of the techniques and issues related to the study of Artificial Intelligence. Software design techniques and algorithms specific to AI were covered including neural networks, decision trees, game trees, probabilistic algorithms, rule-based systems, and search strategies. Applications were examined in game playing, pattern recognition, robotics, machine perception, expert systems, natural language understanding and machine learning.
      </li>
    <h3 class="class-title">CSI 497/498 Senior Seminar in Computing</h3>
      <li>
        CSI 497 required that I designed and defined a project. The project was required to involve current topics in computing and information science and incorporate material from several of the courses required for my majot (Interactive Media). My project had to be researched and documented. Each of us will have to lead a class discussion and make a presentation about their project proposal. Other current topics related to computing and information science as well as careers in those areas are to be presented. (Still in Progress)<br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        (Coming Spring 2018) CSI 498 - This capstone course combines with CSI 497 and requires that students implement a project that was defined in the previous course. Projects will involve current topics in computing and information science and incorporate material from several of the courses required for their major. Projects will be researched and documented with a formal paper completed at its conclusion. Each student will lead a class discussion and make a formal presentation about their project. Other current topics related to computing and information science as well as careers in those areas are presented. This course will concentrate on the definition and design of the project to be implemented.
