            <p>Interactive Media is typically associated with Interactive Media Design, however McKendree’s Interactive Media program was designed quite differently. There is a strong emphasis on artificial intelligence and computing graphics. To reinforce computer graphics physics is required and likewise for AI several programming classes are required. Our program is geared towards things such game design and virtual reality and things such as web design compliment the already developed skills.

All of those long nights figuring out how pointers working and even programming classic problems such as Wumpus World were well worth the reward.</p>

              <p>As of the fall year of 2016-17 McKendree no longer offers Interactive Media as a major, due to the low enrollments into the major. Instead, McKendree is gearing up to offer a Cyber Security Major.</p>

        <p>I have been playing saxophone since 2007. My primary being Tenor Sax, but I am willing to play any saxophone needed for the job. I wish to explore Jazz in unconventional ways. I want to use the fundamentals I’ve learned and apply them to create music that my peers and myself would enjoy.<br><br>
